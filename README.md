# SafeID Wallet

A lightweight, security‑first crypto wallet focused on BNB Smart Chain. This repository currently contains plans and a minimal **Web MVP** you can run locally.

## Features (MVP)
- Generate throwaway wallet (mnemonic) — **demo only**
- Show address + QR
- Check BNB balance via JSON‑RPC

## Roadmap
See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).

## Getting Started
```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev       # runs web wallet in dev mode
```

Or run inside the `webwallet` folder:
```bash
cd webwallet
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

## Security
- Do NOT use the demo for real funds.
- Read [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
